1. Make sure that pip and setuptools are installed in your current Python environment (global or a virtualenv).
2. Run the following commands:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt # Need to use pip to install numpy and other required packages or the next line will fail
    $ python setup.py install

3. Testing and code coverage

    $ python setup.py test

Congratulations, you have the latest pCML version installed.
