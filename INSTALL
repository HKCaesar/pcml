0. We strongly recommend using the Ananconda Python distribution to ensure you have all the required packages.
   While PCML will work with a minimal Python installation, several features will be disabled if you do not have geospatial tools such as GDAL.
   Ananconda can be downloaded here: http://continuum.io/downloads

   Windows installation instructions can be found on the PCML Github page: https://github.com/hpcgislab/pcml

1. PCML can be executed from this working directory without installation.
   Just run 'demo_30min.py' or 'examples.py' to start using PCML.

2. For Linux installations make sure that pip and setuptools are installed in your current Python environment (global or a virtualenv).
3. Run the following commands:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt # Need to use pip to install numpy and other required packages or the next line will fail
    $ python setup.py install

4. Testing and code coverage

    $ python setup.py test

Congratulations, you have the latest PCML version installed.
